    <h1>Welcome to Pygskin</h1>
    <p>The Pygskin project aims to replicate the offensive playcalling habits of specific NCAA football coaches with the power of machine learning. The models are trained on several games of data, focused on a specific college football coach. The models use data like the current down, yardage situation, and offensive metrics to determine what type of play that coach might call in a given situation.</p>
